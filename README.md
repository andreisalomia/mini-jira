# DevOps Learning Project

## Purpose
This project is a hands-on learning environment to progressively apply DevOps principles by evolving a simple application from local development to production-grade infrastructure.

## Step 1 - Simple Local Development & Docker

- Built a simple full-stack issue tracking application
- Implemented core domain logic (auth, projects, issues, workflows)
- Fully containerized frontend, backend, and database using Docker
- Orchestrated services locally with Docker Compose

## Step 2 — Single VM Cloud Deployment

- Deployed the containerized app to a single AWS EC2 VM via SSH  
- Manually installed and configured Docker on a fresh Linux server  
- Exposed services using cloud firewalls (Security Groups)  
- Encountered issues with ssh-key permissions 
- Resolved frontend prod-only failures (build-time env vars, dev proxy assumptions)
- TODO in step 3: get rid of the vite proxy

## Step 3

- Added NGINX as reverse proxy for single entry point (port 80)
- Removed Vite dev proxy - NGINX now handles all routing
- Configured location blocks to route `/` to frontend, `/api` to backend
- Fixed environment variable issues (build-time vs runtime) with Docker build args
- Implemented WebSocket support for Vite hot reload
